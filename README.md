# Checking-N-double-Exist-or-not-


 Approach:

- ✅ Use a **Hash Set** to store seen numbers
- 🔁 For each number, check if its double or half (if even) is already in the set
- ⚡ Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- 🧠 Space Complexity: `O(n)`

---

### 🧠 Why This Matters:
- Strengthens understanding of **hashing**
- Reinforces the importance of **optimization**
- Excellent for **FAANG-style interviews**
